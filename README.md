OpenCV is a popular open-source computer vision library that provides pre-trained Haar cascades and other classifiers for face detection. These classifiers use a set of features and a learning algorithm to detect faces in an image. OpenCV provides a simple and efficient way to perform face detection in real-time, with low computational requirements.

CNNs are a type of deep neural network that can be trained to recognize patterns in images. CNNs have been used extensively in recent years for face detection and recognition tasks. In this approach, a CNN is trained on a large dataset of faces to learn features that can distinguish between faces and non-faces. Once the CNN is trained, it can be used to detect faces in new images.
